# Exercise 1
The first iteration is a bit longer than all the other iterations, which are similar in length. This is due to the overhead that is generated for creating the parallel space.
The output can be found in output.txt in the ipenacc folder.
# Exercise 2
The code is executed even faster then in the previous exercise, about 4.5 times.

# Exercise 3
As we can see in the graphic, the number of threads plays a much more significant role for the execution time, so it seems not to scale linearly.
