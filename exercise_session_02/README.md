  libaec: libaec/1.0.6
    libaec - Adaptive Entropy Coding library Libaec provides fast lossless compression of 1 up to 32 bit wide signed or unsigned

    or numerical model output from weather or climate simulations. While floating point representations are not directly supported,
    they can also be efficiently coded by grouping exponents and mantissa. ***************** SZIP compatibility
    *********************** Libaec includes a free drop-in replacement for the SZIP library
    (http://www.hdfgroup.org/doc_resource/SZIP). Just replace SZIP's shared library libsz.so* with libaec.so* and libsz.so* from
    libaec. Code which is dynamically linked with SZIP such as HDF5 should continue to work with libaec. No re-compilation required.
    HDF5 files which contain SZIP encoded data can be decoded by HDF5 using libaec and vice versa.

To learn more about a package execute:

   $ module spider Foo

where "Foo" is the name of a module.

To find detailed information about a particular package you
must specify the version if there is more than one version:

   $ module spider Foo/11.1

## Exercise 3
I didn't quite understand what you meant by "use `hostname` as the program" but I added the following line:
```bash
#SBATCH --account="uzh8"
```
and I checked if the job was running with the following result:
```bash
[eiger][mfaehnri@eiger-ln001 exercise_session_02]$ sbatch $SCRATCH/hostname.sh
Submitted batch job 3370985
[eiger][mfaehnri@eiger-ln001 exercise_session_02]$ squeue -u mfaehnri
             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
           3370977     debug   my_job mfaehnri PD       0:00      1 (ReqNodeNotAvail, Reserved for maintenance)
           3370984     debug   my_job mfaehnri PD       0:00      1 (ReqNodeNotAvail, Reserved for maintenance)
           3370985     debug   my_job mfaehnri PD       0:00      1 (ReqNodeNotAvail, Reserved for maintenance)
```
For redirection to the log and error file I inserted the following two lines into the .sh file:
```bash
#SBATCH --output="mpi_output.log"
#SBATCH --error="mpi_error.log"
```
