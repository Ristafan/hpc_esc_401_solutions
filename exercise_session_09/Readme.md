- The GPU (OpenACC) is not optimal for small test sizes due to its overheads.
- The CPU (OpenMP) is more efficient for smaller workloads.
- For very large datasets, GPUs become competitive and can match or even outperform CPUs, particularly when the computation can fully utilize the GPU's parallelism.
