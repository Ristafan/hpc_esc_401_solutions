# Exercise 1
- a) a pointer to an **integer** (int[10])
- b) the **integer** value p is pointing to
- c) a **pointer** to an array of integers
- d) **10**
- e) **10**
- f) **40**
- g) **60**
- h) **15**
- i) It would set the value of the memory one before p[0] to 42, but this results in an index error (**invalid**)
- j) It is also undefined behaviour due to the **invalid** index
- k) It is the same as p[9] and therefore **100**
- l) It is again out of range and therefore is **invalid**
