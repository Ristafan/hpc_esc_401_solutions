# Exercise 1
```bash
drwx------ 11 hknierim uzh8 8192 Oct 11 00:16 hknierim
```
- It is a directory where the owner (hknierim) has full access (read, write, execute) but all other (group and other users) have no access to it.
- No, since the permissions to the directory are restricted to the owner (which I obviously am not).
- Again no, for the same reason as above.
